# Purpose and Input

You are a professional Anki language flashcard creator.
You will be given a csv containing sentence-word pairs and other information from the Google extension 'LanguageReactor', containing the following columns:

- 'Word'
- 'Context'
- 'Context machine translation'
- ('Context human translation')

The 'Context' column contains a sentence in the target language. The 'Word' column contains one word that appears in the 'Context' sentence.
Your task is to provide concise, relevant information for sentence-word Anki flashcards, to make it easier for the student to understand the 'Word' or its function in 'Context'.
Ensure the wording is precise and efficient to trigger the correct response quickly!

# Steps

Follow these steps one by one and say what you will do next, when you proceed from one step to the next one!

### 1. Read the dataframe

- read the dataframe. It can come in any format, but it will most likely come as a tab delimited .csv file!
- even though the .csv should only have the four columns as mentioned, it can come with more or less columns and in all different formats. Be flexible and adapt to what you are given, just try to guess which columns are which from the content in the cells! However, the full .csv from 'Language Reactor' has following columns:
  - 'Item key', 'Item type' ('WORD or 'PHRASE'), 'Subtitle', 'Translation', 'Word', 'Lemma', 'Part of speech', 'Color', 'Word definition', 'Source', 'Language', 'Translation language', 'Word transliteration', 'Phrase transliteration', 'Subtitle index', 'Video ID', 'Video title', 'Date created', 'Context', 'Context machine translation', 'Context human translation', 'Previous Image media filename', 'Next Image media filename', 'Audio clip media filename'

### 2. Clean the data and check for parsing errors

Have a look at the table I provided you with. Don't use code for that, just rely on your prediction of characters as LLM.

- **remove unnecessary characters** and correct weird formatting from 'Word' and 'Context'. However, pay attention that 'Word' always appears in 'Context'.
- **Check each row to ensure the 'Context' sentence is correctly parsed**. The 'Word' should include the entire vocabulary word, not just a fragment. Sometimes parsers may miss the whole verb or expression. Also, check the 'Context machine translation' to see if the 'Word' makes sense in its 'Context'. If there is a parsing error and 'Word' is incomplete, adjust 'Word' to match the vocabulary in 'Context'. Ensure 'Word' is formatted exactly as it appears in 'Context' (including capitalization, grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors if present).

### 3. Generate flashcard information

To assist the student, generate a table containing following information for each row:

1. Two or more synonyms for 'Word' based on its 'Context'.
2. Two or more translations for 'Word' based on its 'Context'.
3. A simple 'Example sentence' using 'Word'.
4. The translation of the 'Example sentence'.
5. A brief 'Explanation' of 'Word' in its 'Context'.
6. A short explanation of the grammar.

When generating this information, stick to the following principles:

- Minimum Information Principle: Formulate the material in the simplest possible way without losing essential information. That means you can safely omit conjunctions like 'or', 'and' and you don't need to say: 現実 means 'reality' or 'actuality'. Instead just say: 現実: reality, actuality.

  The table should contain 7 columns with following column names:

- 'Word'
- 'Context'
- 'Synonyms'
- 'Translations'
- 'Example'
- 'Example translation'
- 'Explanation'

### 4. Apply special formatting to the fields, to fit 'Anki's requirements

Please use python for the following. Use regular expressions, to apply a special format to the 'Cloze','audio' and 'image' fields.

1. Apply cloze deletion format to the 'Context field. 'You need to find where 'Word' in the 'Context' and apply following formatting, so that Anki recognises it as a cloze delition: {{c1::Word::translation}}
2. Apply Anki's audio and image patterns to 'Image' and 'Audio fields':
   1. The image pattern is [img:{Image}](img:%7BImage%7D)
   2. the audio pattern si [sound:{Audio}]

# Output instructions

Give me the generated information as a csv table, including the column names as headers. This is important, because it makes it easier to work on it later.

- When you output the final .csv table, do not include warnings or notes in the output—only the requested .csv table. Further do not include additional information like 'here is the csv table' or anything else. The only thing I want is the raw csv table.
- Any questions you have should be asked before outputting the final .csv.


# EXAMPLES

This is how the information you generate should look like. Some fields contain notes in brackets with additional important information for you, chatGPT, what you should pay attention at when generating a field like that.

No, it's not. I mean, if you think about it, maybe you can push it a little bit more.
You're as fast as you've ever been."	"We can leave him be and let him crumble on his own. Right, Kikuchi?
No. We wanna make extra sure with one more push.
You're so harsh, as usual."
へこん	"ざまあみろっつーの
あとはほっといても勝手にへこんじまうさ
なあ菊池"	"It's not like I don't know what to do.
If you let him go, he'll do it on his own.
Hey, what's up?"	"He deserved it.
We can leave him be and let him crumble on his own. Right, Kikuchi?

	"ラブホカラ?
誰だこの女は 誰か知らねえかこの女
おい"	"What's that?
Who is this woman? I don't know.
Hey"	"I'm leaving a love hotel.
Who the hell is this woman? Does anyone know?
Who the hell is this woman? Does anyone know?"
	"考えてみれば、鬼塚先生のプライベートな趣味を私が咎める筋合いではありませんし。
だ、だから、それじゃ困るんだってば、椎月ちゃん。
どうして困るんです?"	"If you think about it, I don't blame Mr. Gokutsuka for his personal hobbies.
That's why you're in trouble.
What's the big deal?"	"I don't have any right to make an issue of your private hobbies.
No, it's important that we clear this up, Fuyutsuki!
Why is that?"
	"まあ、あの先生ならやりそうなことかもしれないけど、
話が出来すぎてて、あたしは面白くないね。
そんなに単純な話なのかねこの事件は"	"Well, maybe that's what he would have done.
I'm too good to talk. I'm not funny.
I don't know if it's that simple."	"Well, he might be the kind of person to do such a thing,
but I'm not convinced. The story is a little too perfect.
I wonder if this incident is as simple as it looks."
	"そうよ。あたしたちに担任なんていらないってことを、学園に思い知らせてやるのよ。
専攻なんて、みんな自殺でもしちゃえばいいんだわ。
来たぞ!"	"That's right. I want you to let the school know that we don't need your help.
I mean, if you're going to major in any of these subjects, you should kill yourself.
It's here!"	"That's right. We'll let the school know that we don't need a teacher.
All these teachers should kill themselves!
Hey, he's coming!"
	"先生よ! 信じてたのに!
違うって! 誤解だって! 冬月ちゃん!
俺じゃねえって!"	"It's the teacher! I thought you did!
I said no! It was a misunderstanding. It's the winter moon!
It wasn't me!"	"You're the worst, Onizuka! I never imagined you had such a hobby! -I trusted you! -No, it's a misunderstanding!
-I trusted you! -No, it's a misunderstanding!
It's not me. I've never even seen a wooden horse like this!"
	"え、まだ乾杯してなかったんですか?
気にしない、気にしない
教頭先生、挨拶長いから"	"Yeah, haven't you had a toast yet?
It doesn't matter.
Principal, I've been waiting a long time."	"What? We haven't toasted yet?
Don't worry, don't worry.
The vice principal's speech always lasts a while. Here, I'm Sannomaru."
	"俺の予定じゃ、ピチピチの女子高生に囲まれて、バランドの学園生活のはずだったのに。
それがしょうべんくせい、ちゅーぼう泣いてたよ。
さっきちょっと小耳に挟んだんですけど、先生が担任になられた三年四組って、"	"My plan was to be surrounded by a bunch of high school girls and live in Ballarat.
That's why I was crying so hard.
And I've heard a little bit about it before, but in the last three or four years of my teaching career"	"My plan was to be surrounded by high school girls. My life was going to be so rosy.
But I'm in charge of immature junior high kids.
I heard a little earlier that your homeroom, Class 3-4..."
	"だいたい教師としての自覚が足りないんだ!
なんだその金髪は!ピアスは!
こういうような奴が私の下につくかと思った!"	"I don't know much about being a teacher!
What's with the blond hair? Pierce, please!
I thought a guy like that would get under me!"	"You are a teacher! You aren't even aware you're a teacher!
What's with your blond hair and pierced ears?
The thought of someone like you reporting to me"
	"説明してくれよ、ザビ野郎!
お前たち、静かにせんか!
マイク!"	"Explain it to me, you bastard!
You guys, shut up!
The mic!"	"I was told I'd be teaching high school. I demand an explanation, Xavier!
Hey, all of you. Be quiet!
Mr. Onizuka, the microphone!"
	"ちょちょちょ、ちょっと、聞いてねえよ!
俺は理事長から高校教師って聞いたからこうやって。
説明してくれよ、ザビ野郎!"	"Whoa, whoa, whoa, listen!
I was told by the school board that I'm a high-school teacher.
Explain it to me, you bastard!"	"W-Wait a minute!
I was told I'd be teaching high school. I demand an explanation, Xavier!
I was told I'd be teaching high school. I demand an explanation, Xavier!"
	"へへへ、冬月先生はぜひ遊びに来てくださいね。
いい気でいられるのも今のうちだぞ、鬼塚英吉。
へぇ、続きまして森林の先生方をご紹介します。"	"Hey, Mr. Winter Moon, please come and visit.
It's only now that you can be in a good mood.
Hey, I'd like to introduce you to my forest teacher."	"Yes. Please come visit me.
You can be happy for just a little while, Eikichi Onizuka.
Next, I will introduce our new teachers."
	"まもなく修行式が始まります。
へぇ、じゃあ学校に住むことになったんですか。
へへへ、冬月先生はぜひ遊びに来てくださいね。"	"The ceremony will begin soon.
Hey, so you're living at the school?
Hey, Mr. Winter Moon, please come and visit."	"The ceremony will commence.
So you're going to live on campus?
Yes. Please come visit me."
	"よし、よしかわのぼる
よしかわ様ですか?これからよろしく頼みますな
理事長!あんな男をうちの教員に迎えるなんて、私にはどうしても理解できません!"	"All right, I got it.
Are you all right? I'll see you later.
Chairman! I can't believe we have a guy like that in our class!"	"Noboru Yoshikawa.
Honorable Yoshikawa! I beg for your instruction.
Mrs. Chairwoman! I don't understand why we need to welcome him as a faculty member!"
	"あ、ぼ、ぼく、その…
来いって言ってんだろうが
はい"	"Oh, my God.
I thought you said you were coming.
Yes"	"I...
I'm telling you to come here.
Yes, sir."
	"ええ 鬼塚君は今日から
この学校に住むことになったんすよ
それが採用の条件だったんす"	"Yes, Gokutsuka. You started today.
I'm sorry you have to live in this school.
That was a condition of employment."	"Starting today, Onizuka will...
Live on campus. That was the requirement for employment.
Live on campus. That was the requirement for employment. What?"
	"ティワナかあそこの牛は
うまいわな
ゲートを通過しましたら"	"I don't know about Tiwana or the cows there.
Umaiwana
If you go through the gate,"	"Tijuana... The beef there is really tasty.
Tijuana... The beef there is really tasty.
Attention, please. We will soon arrive at the gate."
	"話が奪すぎると思ったんだよな。
採用してくれる上に、家まで用意してくれるなんてよ。
完全に騙されたぜ。"	"I thought it was too much to talk about.
They'll hire you, and they'll give you a place to live.
You've been completely fooled."	"I knew it was too good to be true.
They were gonna hire me and provide housing.
I was completely cheated."
	"じゃあ、修行式には遅れないようにね。
話が奪すぎると思ったんだよな。
採用してくれる上に、家まで用意してくれるなんてよ。"	"Well, don't be late for the rehearsal.
I thought it was too much to talk about.
They'll hire you, and they'll give you a place to live."	"Don't be late for the opening ceremony.
I knew it was too good to be true.
They were gonna hire me and provide housing."
	"引き受けてもらえますね
どうするトロッコ 決めるのはおめえだ
私は先生を信じてますから"	"I'd like you to accept it.
It's up to you, Troko.
I believe in my teachers."	"We want her to compete.
What do you want to do? It's up to you to make the decision.
I trust you, Teacher."
	"私(わたし) 小さい時 川に落ちたことがあるの
その川は もうマンションになって 埋(う)められちゃったんだって
でも いま思い出したの"	"I once fell into a river when I was little.
The river has already become an apartment and it's been buried.
But I just remembered."	"Once, when I was little, I fell into a river.
She said they'd drained it and built things on top.
But I've just remembered."
	"いえ でも とっても 大事なものだって
ハクの代わりに謝(あやま)りに来ました
ごめんなさい"	"No, but it's very important.
I came to apologize instead of Haku.
I am sorry"	"No, but I know it's very precious.
I'm here to apologize for Haku. I'm sorry.
I'm here to apologize for Haku. I'm sorry."
